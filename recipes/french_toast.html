    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        French toast is a dish of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and often milk or cream, then pan fried.
    </p>

    <p>
        When French toast is served as a sweet dish, sugar, vanilla, or cinnamon are also commonly added before
        pan-frying, and then it may be topped with sugar (often powdered sugar), butter, fruit, or syrup. When it is a
        savory dish, it is generally fried with a pinch of salt or pepper, and it can then be served with a sauce such
        as ketchup or mayonnaise.
